# GitHub API Usage Guide

## Overview
This guide outlines how to use the GitHub API to manage repository files, including retrieving file contents and updating files. The operations are based on the `v2_schema.yml` schema for the GitHub Repository Management Action.

## Retrieving File Contents
Before updating a file in a GitHub repository, it's essential to retrieve its current contents and SHA.

### GET Request: Retrieve Content from a File

Make a GET request to the GitHub API to retrieve the file contents. Include the appropriate parameters for the owner, repository, and the path of the file in question. Consider using a library like `requests` for this operation.

## Updating File Contents
Once you have the file's SHA from the GET operation, you can update the file's contents. This requires a PUT request to the same endpoint, including the new contents, SHA, and a commit message. Consider using base64 encoding for the file contents and including it in the put request.
